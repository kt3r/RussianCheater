As you probably guessed, I'm Russian and I like programming. I started programming very early in life like when I was 9 I did scratch and learned it in about a day while my friends were still struggling.
I learned Lua when I was 10 mainly because I got a PC and started making games in Roblox.
I learned Python when I was 10 too because my teacher was like "Oh you're a natural! I have a challenge! Go home and learn Python." I went home, learned Python in a day, and came back and wrote a whole game just with Python.
I learned C# when I was 12 because I started doing things in Unity.
I learned JavaScript when I was 13 because I did things in Minecraft.

I like programming a lot! :D

Oh and I like Cybersecurity too.
